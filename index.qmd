  We are an [interdisciplinary]{.fw-bolder} research group based within the [Department of Materials Science](https://www.ww.tf.fau.de/){.text-primary .text-decoration-none .fw-semibold} at the [Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg](https://www.fau.de/){.text-primary .text-decoration-none .fw-semibold}. 
We develop advanced algorithms for efficient processing, reliable reconstruction, and automated information extraction from multidimensional microscopy datasets, predominantly in electron and X-ray microscopy. We have expertise in [deep learning, large-scale optimization, signal and image processing, and experimental design]{.fw-bolder} for advanced [X-ray and electron microscopy]{.fw-bolder} experiments.

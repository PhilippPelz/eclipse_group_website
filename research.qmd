## Research Topics

### Clinical Topics

- **Behavioral synchrony** – We are interested in studying the emergence of behavioral synchronization between members of interacting dyads (e.g., therapists and patients or parents and children). We are applying this to studying the development of the working alliance (i.e., therapeutic relationship) during psychotherapy for depression and the communication dynamics between parents and children at high risk of suicide. As part of this effort, we are working on creating an R package for the windowed cross-correlation technique for quantifying behavioral synchrony ([Boker et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10/dzffkm)).

### Methodological Topics

- **Interrater reliability statistics** – We are interested in developing statistical techniques that quantify the degree of reliability (e.g., agreement or consistency) between raters in observational and judgment studies. As part of this effort, we are working on finalizing the [agreement](https://github.com/jmgirard/agreement) R package for chance-adjusted indexes of categorical agreement and are working on integrating insights and tools from Bayesian statistics and generalizability theory in the [varde](https://github.com/jmgirard/varde) R pacakge.

## Research Framework

### Affective Communication

The substantive focus of our work is on how humans communicate important affective (e.g., emotional) information to one another. The four pillars of this work are on structure, context, dynamics, and functionality. In studying the **structure** of affective communication, we investigate the production and perception of visual behaviors (e.g., facial expressions, gestures, and body motion), vocal behaviors (e.g., pitch, loudness, and timbre), and verbal behaviors (e.g., syntax, semantics, and discourse). In studying the **context** of affective communication, we investigate the influence of the immediate and distal sociocultural environment. In studying the **dynamics** of affective communication, we investigate the unfolding of emotion, behavior, and the interpersonal field over time. Finally, in studying the **functionality** of affective communication, we investigate its relationships with mental health, pathology, and recovery.

### Affective Computing

Supporting the four pillars of substantive research described above is a methodological foundation of computer and data science. The three main aspects of this methodological work are statistics, computing, and design. The **statistical** aspects largely focus on developing and applying Bayesian, multilevel, and latent variable models to test hypotheses about interpretable parameters or validate the other aspects. The **computational** aspects largely focus on building tools to collect large amounts of data and then using machine learning to process that data and make predictions. Finally, the **design** aspects largely focus on developing software to collect, process, and analyze research data as well as websites to educate researchers on methodological and substantive topics.
